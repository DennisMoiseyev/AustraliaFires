# Australia Brush Fires
I feel that art can be a way of expressing and capturing pivotal moments in the world
around us. It can serve as a method of raising awareness and drawing our attention
towards a particular topic. One of the most devastating events affecting the world
right now is the brushfires in Australia. In my artistic scene, which I title *Australia Fires*, a 
series of trees scattered around the green canvas are engulfed in hundreds of flames. Behind the 
burning brush, you can see a couple of koalas, native to Australia, peeking their faces out 
through the flames. This tragedy unfortunately isn't receiving the importance it deserves. It's saddening
to see such an event happening, especially with the destruction of the koala habitat (which
are one of my favorite animals).
